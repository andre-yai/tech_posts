## Intro

Nowadays, many companies are migrating from their on-premise stations to the cloud. As such, AWS has become one of the main and most adopted cloud providers followed by Azure and GCP.

Therefore getting an AWS Certification can lead you to new and sometimes better job opportunities.

For the most part in AWS certifications, you don't need to follow a particular order. The exceptions are AWS Professional Architect and AWS Professional DevOps Engineer.

I had some experience taking AWS Certifications. I had gotten certifications in AWS Developer Associate and AWS Machine Learning Specialty nd plan to get more in the near future.
