DMS - Database Migration Service
- Resilient and self healing
- Data remains available after migration
- Supports: Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Migrations.
- Continuous Data Replication using CDC
- EC2 instance to perform the replication task.

Sources
- OnPremise, Aurora, RDS, Azure SQL Database 
Destination
- OnPremise and EC2 instances. RDS, Redshift, DynamoDB, S3, ElasticSearch,
Kinesis, DocumentDB.

# Schema Conversion Tool
- Not same engine do a schema convertion.
- OLTP , OLAP


# Direct Connect.
- Provides a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC
- Dedicated connection must be setup between your DC and AWS Direct Connection locations.
- Need to setup VP Gateway to your VPC.
- Access S3 and EC2 
- Increase bandwith throughput
- More consistent network experience.
- Hybrid environment.
- Direct Connect Gateway: Connect to diferent regions.

- Dedicated Connections
- Hosted Connection
- Lead time to set new connections longer than 1 month to establish a new connection.

Security
- No encryption but is private. 
- Provides a IPsec connection. But difficult to implement.

Resilent
- High Resilient: One connection at multiple locations.
- Maximum: seperate connection terminating on separate devices in more than one location.


# Snow Familiy

- High-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge and migrate data to AWS.
- Migration: Snowcone, Snowball Edge, Snowmobile.
- Edge: Snowcone, Snowball Edge
- Challenges: Limited connectivity, bandwidthm network cost, bandwidth.

## SnowCone
- Migration: light, secure, 8TB. AWS DataSync.  24PB online and offline
- Edge: Process computation on edge location. Doing ML, Process Data.

## Snowball Edge
- Migration: 80TB. Petabyte
- Edge: Process computation on edge location. Doing ML, Process Data

## SnowMobile
- Migration: Truck. 1EB = 100PB
- High Secure.
