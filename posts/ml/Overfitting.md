# **Explaining** Overfitting!!

Overfitting is one of the biggest problems in machine learning models. It happens when a model is too ajusted to the training dataset. So that, it lose performance when predicting on new dataset. In this article I will present a simple overview and how we can avoid this problem.

A machine learning model is constructed on using a sample dataset. However, this dataset sometimes does not represent the whole scenario of the data population. Therefore a model constructed on it will tend to overfitted becoming too ajusted to data presented on the dataset and leading to potencial problems when applied to new dataset. 

## How to avoid.
There are some ways to prevent overfitting in our model by:
- adding more data.
- reducing number of features. 
- dealing with Regularization.
- early stopping.
