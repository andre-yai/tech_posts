# **Explaining** Overfitting!!

Overfitting is one of the biggest problems in machine learning models. It happens when a model is too ajusted to the training dataset. So when we train with new data the model loose it performace.

## How it usually happens?
- Unbalanced Data.
- No use of splitting data. No partition on training, validation and testing.
- No use of crossvalidation.
- Use of some complex models. Example: ramdom forest, xgboosting, neural networks, deep learning.

## How to avoid.
- Graphic comparing performace.
- Training on more data.
- Bigger learning rate.
