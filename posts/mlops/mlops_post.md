## Rise of MLOps
Recently, we have seen an rapidily growth of data science and machine learing in industry. With that some challenges has begin to appear. 
Problems like: 
- Productionazing machine learning projects.
- Standarlizing Projects
- Dealing with data drifts and concept drift.
- Dealing with model's performace loss.

There came MLOps. According to Google, MLOlps is an ML Engineering culture and practices that aims at unifying ML system development (Dev) and ML system operations (Ops).

# Components of Machine Learning Operations

## Development
    - Templates:
        - What is it
        Example: Kedro, Cookiecutter.
    - Feature store
## Production
    - Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Training
    - Monitoring and Meta data Store
